10.2 Randomized Meldable Heap
	Operations
		Meld(h1,h2)
			also referred to as merge
			compares to see which heap is appendee vs. appender
		MakeHeap(x)
		add(x)
			Meld(new Heap(x), h2)
		remove()
			Removes smallest value in the heap
				Stored at the root
				Removing the first node splits two heaps.
				Then meld those two heaps
		remove(p)
			Takes a pointer to a node
			Just cut it out.
			return Meld(Meld(p->parent, p->left), p->right)
	
	What is a heap?
		Heap Property
			The priority of a node is smaller than each of its children
		

	How do we meld / merge to Heaps?
		1. First compare what heap is the original by comparing priority of
			head nodes
		2.
