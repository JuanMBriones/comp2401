n=2 therefore 0000001 is 0000010 which is 4 (2^2)
0011010 = 2^1 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 8 + 16 = 28
0000100 &
=======
0000000 >> n=2 = 0000000

Therefore 0000000 = 0
The bit at index 2 (0,1,2) from the right side is 0.

Lets say n=1

0000001 << 1 = 0000010

0011010
0000010 &
= 0000010 >> 1
= 0000001 = 0
The bit at index 1 (0,1) from the right side is a 1 (not a 0)
