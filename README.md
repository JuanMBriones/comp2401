    <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
    <small>
    Provides the end user with the ability to encrypt and decrypt messages, using a secret key.
    
    Your program will prompt the user to indicate whether they wish to encrypt a readable 
    (“plaintext”) message or decrypt an already encrypted sequence of numbers 
    (“ciphertext”) back to its readable form.

    <h3>Assignment 2</h3>
    <small>
      You will write a program in C, in the Ubuntu Linux environment, to help the user compute their final grade in a course, 
      based on multiple weighting schemes. Your program will prompt the user to enter the major course components. 
      These are the items that are given weights in the course outline, for example Assignments, Tutorials, Tests, Final 
      exam, etc. Then your program will prompt the user to enter some weighting schemes, with one value for each course 
      component. For example, one weighting scheme could have 50% for Assignments, 10% for Tutorials and 40% for the 
      Final exam. Another weighting scheme could weigh the Assignments at 40% and the Final exam at 60%. Finally, your 
      program will prompt the user to enter the grade they received for each component, and print out the final grade the 
      user would get based on each weighting scheme.
