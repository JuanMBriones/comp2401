Assignment 2

You will write a program in C, in the Ubuntu Linux environment, to help the user compute their final grade in a course, 
based on multiple weighting schemes. Your program will prompt the user to enter the major course components. 
These are the items that are given weights in the course outline, for example Assignments, Tutorials, Tests, Final 
exam, etc. Then your program will prompt the user to enter some weighting schemes, with one value for each course 
component. For example, one weighting scheme could have 50% for Assignments, 10% for Tutorials and 40% for the 
Final exam. Another weighting scheme could weigh the Assignments at 40% and the Final exam at 60%. Finally, your 
program will prompt the user to enter the grade they received for each component, and print out the final grade the 
user would get based on each weighting scheme.


In this assignment, you will:
• define the data type that represents the collection of course components and weighting schemes
• break down the required functionality into modular, reusable functions
• write the functions to prompt the user for the required course component and weighting scheme data, as well as 
the user’s grades, and compute a final grade using each weighting scheme
